## FastQC (Interactive run)

### 1. Open interactive session
Open interactive session in compute canada (e.g. 1 hour, 2 tasks=2 cores)
```bash
salloc --time=1:0:0 --ntasks=2 --account=def-taubert
```

On cedar resource allocation:
- See [compute canada documentation](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Running_jobs)
- somehow when i ask for 6 tasks it doenst allow me to run 6-threaded fastqc LOL (will show "killed" when all running); but can run 3-threaded fastqc (just run 3 at once)

--- 
### 2. Load fastqc module

Load fastQC:
```bash
[jyan@cdr774 raw]$ module load fastqc
```

Use the following command to see which modules are currently loaded: 
```bash
[jyan@cdr774 raw]$ module list
```

Now we can call fastqc using command. It has also been added to `$PATH`.

**Additional**:
To check the PATH they are located:
```bash
[jyan@cdr774 raw]$ echo $PATH
```
To check which fastQC version is available:
```bash
module spider
```

---

### 3. Run fastqc
Navigate to the folder with all the fastq files.

If run single-threaded fastqc, files will be processed sequentially:
```bash
fastqc *.fastq
```

If run multi-threaded fastqc, files will be processed sequentially:
```bash
fastqc -t 3 *.fastq
```

Then just wait for them to get done! (one run of one file = ~10 mins)

To check all parameters for fastqc (including -t = threads)
```bash
% fastqc --help      # check usage and version number
```

If it kills some of them randomly, can run one by one instead.

### 4. FastQC results
Make a new fastqc folder one level above and move the fastqc files there:
```bash
cd ..
mkdir fastqc

cd raw
mv *fastqc* ../fastqc
```

now all the fastqc results are in the specified folder.

If you don't know what your username is, run `echo $USER` on the cluster.


Finally, Exit the interactive session:
```bash
exit
```

To copy the results folder to Mac desktop:
```bash
Judiths-MacBook-Pro-2:Desktop judithyan$ scp jyan@cedar.computecanada.ca:~/scratch/GSE123507/fastqc/* ~/Desktop
```

## FastQC (as job submission)

### 1. Make script

First make a .run file under /scripts

```bash
vim GSE123507_fastqc.run
```

Vim tutorial: See [here](https://github.com/hbctraining/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-gt/blob/master/lessons/03_vim.md)
- `i` to get into edit mode, `esc` to quit to command mode
- in command mode:
	- `:w` = write/save
	- `:q` = quit
	- `:wq` = save and quit
	- `:q!` = quit without saving

Script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --time=2:00:00
#SBATCH --account=def-taubert
#SBATCH --job-name=GSE123507_fastqc
#SBATCH --output=%x-%j.out
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=16000M
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2
#SBATCH --output=%x-%j.out

cd ~/scratch/GSE123507/raw
module load fastqc
fastqc *.fastq
mv *fastqc* ../fastqc2/

```

Start run:
```bash
sbatch GSE123507_fastqc.run
```

Check status:
```bash
sacct
```

Can exit and come back at any time.
